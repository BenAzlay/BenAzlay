# Hi, I'm Benjamin Azoulay 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a software engineer by trade, an innovator by passion, and a Web3 adventurer by heart. With over **5 years of full-stack wizardry** and **3 years exploring the Blockchain multiverse**, I build things that (hopefully) make the decentralized world a better place.

## 🌟 Projects I'm Proud Of

### [Riskophobe](https://riskophobe.com)
Ever wished options trading existed in crypto? Meet Riskophobe, the dApp that lets you buy tokens with a twist—you can return them and reclaim your collateral. It’s risk management, but make it DeFi.

### [Flashstake](https://flashstake.io)
Staking rewards now, not later. Flashstake rewrites the rules by giving you instant upfront rewards for staking. Yes, it’s as cool as it sounds—like time travel for DeFi.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Full-Stack Development**: React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript—I speak fluent frontend and backend.
- **Blockchain & Web3**: Solidity, Hardhat, The Graph, ethers.js—making smart contracts smarter.
- **Smart Contract Development**: DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. If it’s on the blockchain, I’m probably building it.
- **GraphQL**: Turning blockchain data into something humans (and dApps) can understand.
